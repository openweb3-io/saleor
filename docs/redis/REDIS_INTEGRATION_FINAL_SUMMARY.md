# Redis Integration Final Implementation Summary

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Overview

Successfully replaced the in-memory storage solution with Redis, and now obtain the Redis instance from the backend.env configuration. Complete storage and verification functionality for email change verification codes has been implemented.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### 1. Redis Connection Configuration

**File**: `saleor/graphql/account/mutations/authentication/telegram_email_change_request.py`
**File**: `saleor/graphql/account/mutations/authentication/telegram_email_change_confirm.py`

- Obtains the Redis cache instance from backend.env configuration
- Retrieves Redis configuration from environment variables
- Prints Redis configuration for debugging
- Uses Django cache system, which automatically handles Redis connection

### 2. Verification Code Storage

- Stores verification codes in Redis with expiration
- Uses unique keys for each verification request
- Ensures codes are deleted after use or expiration

### 3. Code Refactoring

- Removed all in-memory storage logic
- Unified all verification code storage to use Redis
- Added integration and expiration tests

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Verified that verification codes are correctly stored and retrieved from Redis
- Confirmed that codes expire as expected
- All tests pass in both local and containerized environments

## ðŸš€ Deployment

- Ensure Redis is available in the deployment environment
- Set `REDIS_URL` in environment variables or `.env` file
- No additional dependencies required if using Django's cache framework

## âœ… Status

- Redis integration is complete and production-ready
- All verification code storage and retrieval for Telegram email change now uses Redis
- Supports scalable and distributed deployments
