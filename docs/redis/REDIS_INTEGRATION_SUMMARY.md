# Redis Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the verification code storage for Telegram email change functionality from in-memory to Redis, ensuring that after containerized deployment, Redis instances can be accessed via configuration.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Using Django Cache System

**Advantages:**

- No need to install the redis module directly
- Utilizes the project's existing cache configuration
- Automatically handles Redis connection and configuration
- Supports multiple cache backends (Redis, Memcached, etc.)

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

- Redis configuration is read from environment variables (e.g., `REDIS_URL`)
- Supports both development and production environments

### 3. Code Changes

- Refactored verification code storage logic to use Django cache
- Removed all in-memory storage code
- Added Redis integration tests

## Key Files

- `saleor/graphql/account/mutations/authentication/telegram_email_change_request.py`
- `saleor/graphql/account/mutations/authentication/telegram_email_change_confirm.py`
- `tests/redis/test_django_cache_redis.py`

## Testing

- Verified that verification codes are stored and retrieved from Redis
- Confirmed that codes expire as expected
- All tests pass in both local and containerized environments

## Deployment

- Ensure Redis is available in the deployment environment
- Set `REDIS_URL` in environment variables or `.env` file
- No additional dependencies required if using Django's cache framework

## Conclusion

The Redis integration is complete, robust, and production-ready. All verification code storage and retrieval for Telegram email change now uses Redis, supporting scalable and distributed deployments.
