## 📋 Assessment Overview

This report evaluates the impact on project functionality after moving test case files and documentation from the root directory to their respective feature directories.

## 🔍 Impact Analysis

### ✅ Unaffected Features

#### 1. Core Business Logic

- **GraphQL Mutations**: All core implementation files remain in place
- **Django Tests**: Official test file locations remain unchanged

#### 2. Imports and Dependencies

- All import paths have been updated as needed
- No import errors detected after file movement

#### 3. CI/CD and Automation

- Test discovery and execution scripts have been updated
- No issues found in CI/CD pipeline

### ⚠️ Potential Risks

- Custom scripts or hardcoded paths may need to be updated
- Documentation links should be checked for accuracy

## 📝 Conclusion

- **No functional impact** detected from file and documentation reorganization
- Project structure is now more maintainable and modular
- All tests pass and documentation is accessible

**Recommendation:** Continue to monitor for any edge cases or overlooked scripts, but the migration is considered successful.
